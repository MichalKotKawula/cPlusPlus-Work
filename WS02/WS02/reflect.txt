After completing this workshop I have gained the ability to retrive records from text files using input file stream object such as "StringSet::StringSet(const char* theString)" where I retrived lines from the Gutenberg Shakespare file.
I have also expanded my knowledge about the implementation of the std::chrono library, which surprised me with it's nanosecond accuracy, and interesting implementation in our workshop.
It is definetly a handy tool when evaluatung code efficency within advanced programs witch contain massive amounts of data to transfer. 

During this workshop, I have encountered difficulties with "StringSet" function which used file stream objects.
It was my first time using more advanced stream object functions of the fstream library and it took me a while to get a hold of them.
By reading the library documentation on cplusplus reference site I solved most of my issues.


1. The reason for the significant time difference between copy "StringSet& StringSet:: operator=(const StringSet& s)" and move "StringSet& StringSet::operator=(StringSet&& pass)"
operations is due to the address of the resources getting reasigned from one to another, without using as much memory as copying.
Copying takes up more memory to copy old object to new object, therefore it's slower.
