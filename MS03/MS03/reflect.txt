After completing milestone 3 I have gained more in depth knowlege about STL containers and algorithms throughout functions such as "for_each" or "any_of" in the Line Manager construtor. 
I have also imporved my implementation skills of deque with customerOrder pending, completed, incomplete in Workstation module and LineManager module. 
I had certain difficulties with getting the desired output, because of incorrect implementation of CustomerOrder constructor where the logic was incomplete extracting tokens, I'm unsure how I haven't noticed it earlier but it came out as an issue in my MS3.
When implementing attemptToMoveOrder() function I had cerntain difficulites with understanding the syntax of moving the order to completed queue, but after a bit of researchand trial and error I have solved my issue by implementing  incomplete.push_back(std::move(m_orders.front())); and completed.push_back(std::move(m_orders.front()));.

By finishing this project I refreshed my memory on many topics and had a chance to implement my gained knowledge thorughout this semester.
Although I wish the instructions regarding certain implementations of functions in this project had been easier to understand and did not require in depth analysis to fully comprehend, I appreciated this opportunity.
